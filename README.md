This tasty twist provides an original take on a classic DOM
manipulation flavor. Features include node manipulation, event handling,
document ready asynchronicity, and AJAX requests.

  removeClass(args)

  children()

  parent()

  empty()

  remove()

Event Handling:

Document ready asynchronicity:

  The core $cinnaDOM function provides a method to delay the invocation
  of functions until the DOM fully renders.  


AJAX Requests:

  AJAX method takes an options hash (set of key/value pairs) and uses
  the XMLHttpRequest API to send and receive data from a server.
